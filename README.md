# Plants Analysis Working Group (AWG)

**OSDR AWGs Overview**  
The [Open Science Data Repository (OSDR)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/) is a science collaboration initiative that provides an open-access data system designed to help scientists discover and access space-relevant datasets to perform primary, secondary, and meta-analyses. OSDR has established the [Analysis Working Groups (AWGs)](https://osdr.nasa.gov/bio/awg/about.html) to optimize the metadata, data, and features available to maximize the gain of new knowledge from such rare and complex datasets. The AWGs will assess and improve the effectiveness of the OSDR through intensive utilization of OSDR resources and generate higher-order data. This GitHub repository is dedicated for Plants AWG members to share and collaborate on their work and codes.

**Plants AWG Overview**  
The Plants Analysis Working Group is comprised of international research scientists and professors working together with a shared goal of developing a central document exploring the metadata and scientific findings from spaceflight and ground-based experiments. The group's meta-analysis research focused on the transcriptional response of Arabidopsis to spaceflight and the integration of epigenetics, proteomics, and glycomic datasets to make predictions and guide future research into the metabolic response of crops in orbit. Additionally, the group has contributed to building new analysis pipelines, providing input on standardizing plant metadata terms, and publishing collaborative manuscripts utilizing GeneLab omics data. This working group is striving to enhance the visibility and utility of GeneLab and spur new collaborations to develop the fundamental and applied knowledge to enable long-term spaceflight and ground-based advances to agriculture. Plants AWG members meet regularly to share and discuss the latest developments in AstroBotany – the discipline of botany concerned with interactions between plant biology and the space environment.
